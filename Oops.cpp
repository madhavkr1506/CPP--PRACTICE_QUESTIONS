Why oops?

c++ language was designed with main intention of adding object oriented features to c language.
As the size of the program increases, readability, maintainability and bug-free nature of the program decreases.
This was the major problem with languages like c which relied upon function or procedures (hence the name procedural programming language).
As a result, the possibility of not adding the problem in an effective manner was high.
Also, as data was almost neglected, data security was easily compromised.
Using classes solves this problem by modelling program as a real world scenario.

Procedure oriented programming =>

Consists of writing a set of instructions for the computer to follow.
Main focus is on functions and not on flow of data.
Function can either use local or global data.
data moves openly from function to function.

Object oriented programming =>

Works on the concept of classes and objects.
A class a templete to create objects. 
Treats data as a critical element.
Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the objects.

Basic concept in Object Oriented Programming =>

Classes : Basic template for creating objects.
Objects : Basic run time entities.
Data Abstraction and Encapsulation : Wrapping data and functions into single unit.
Inheritance : Properties of one class can be inherited into others.
Polymorphism : Ability to take more than one forms.
Dynamic binding : Code which will execute is not known until the program runs.
Message passing : Object.message(information) call format.

Benefits of Object Oriented Programming =>
Better code reusability using objects and inheritance.
Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems.
Multiple objects con co-exist without any interference.
Software complexity can be easily managed.
